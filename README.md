# v2-action-signing-python
Python package to sign on-chain self-custodial requests for orders, transfers, deposits, withdrawals and RFQs.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you 8baller for building a full Python client for the v2 API. Much of the signing logic in the repo was used to inform this package: https://github.com/8ball030/lyra_client

## Developing

1. Create venv and run `pip install -e .`, this reflects changes in package immediately in venv
2. Install dev related packages with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
